As of 10.4 there has been no major changes. All of my time has went to other courses and exams.

What there is still left to do is

i) Implement a distinguishable difference between Linear and Polynomial regression. This will be done by implementing
classes for both of them. Since linear regression is just a special case of polynomial regression, linear regression
will use polynomial regression under the hood.

ii) Finish up all the small details in the GUI. I'm possible changing the GUI so that you can see the details of the
regression model with the picture at the same time.

iii) Write Unit Tests that check that the math behind the model is correct

iv) Write a proper documentation about the program

v) If I have the time left, implement a logistic regression. If I get everything done in the list before in a reasonable
time, then the implementation should be doable.
